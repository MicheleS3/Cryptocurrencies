# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The intent of this analysis was to see what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and determine how to group them to create a classification system for investments.  The analysis was conducted in four main steps of pre-processing the data, reducing the dimensions with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering the cryptocurrencies using K-means, and visualizing the results with hvplot.
